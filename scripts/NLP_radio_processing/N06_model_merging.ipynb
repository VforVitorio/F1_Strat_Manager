    "$Radio Message → [Sentiment Analysis] → [Intent Classification] → [Entity Extraction] → Structured Data$\n",

    "The Structured data is neccesary to output a **standarized JSON format** that would be used by the logical agent in week 5 planning, alongside other models.\n",

    "## Objetives of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives and task to be done in this notebook are the following ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Configure the mmodel paths*: first step, where I will configure the structure of the JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Load the pretrained models*: I will implement a function that will load the three elected models for making the radio analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Prediction functions*: for each mdel, it is necessary to implement a function where each models make their predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Audio Transcription*: first example usage, where I´ll use again Whisper for transcribing the radio message. Important for the urute if we want to directly pass the agent radio messages by radio.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Integrating the pipeline into a single function*: this function will make the predictions of the three models.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. *Analyzing text or audio examples*: two cells are going to be implemented for making the predictions in different types of radio formats.\n"
