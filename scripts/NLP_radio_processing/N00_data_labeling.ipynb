Yeah, it was quite good. Quite cool. It's been a hell of a run and yeah, it was always going to come to a close at one point, but brush yourself down and go again next weekend. Yeah, it's okay.

In a way, I'm a bit disappointed, but well done everyone. Alex, well done. You drove admirably today and we didn't get it all right, as you said on decisions, that's on our shoulders as well, but you caught back up and in a dry race you would have finished sixth, so I'm out. Either way, well done. This is some difficult conditions across this weekend and you brought home some really good points. Yeah, thanks James. I think in a weird way that some of the quicker cars behind us, I felt took a bit more risk with the pitting early thing, because I could. Yeah, copy that. You know we'll review it, but in the meantime, if I told you we were going to come here and get a bit of my arm off, hold up. Thank you. Why don't everyone. Thank you. Why don't everyone.

So the people who have stopped is Bottas onto medium, Stroll onto medium, you and Lawson onto medium, and Russell's gone under hard. Other people have not stopped yet, they're all still on soft.

      "Driver 31: Okay, and that is P10. So in the end we were the only car that finished that did a three stop. Everyone else did two. Yeah, copy. There was no way in trying because the deck was super high so... Yeah, absolutely right. It was worth a go. A bit of luck slightly differently and it could have been a very different story. So well done for sticking with it. Still from P14, I'll take a point.\n",

      "Driver 40: Okay Liam, so Yuki got a penalty and that's P13 for you today. P13, good effort, good effort. I think you should be pleased. Cool, yeah. Considering the amount of time that we lost at the start, yeah. Good job. I enjoyed that. Okay, glad you enjoyed it. Still a lot of work ahead and we get ready again. Unfortunate with the penalty, very unfortunate. But you did all the right things today and we review the details for next time. Yeah, for sure. To be honest, I started to get a bit more of a feeling on the soft when I got clean air. That medium set I didn't feel very comfortable on, but I started to get more of an understanding on that soft. Yeah, I copied that. And we wanted to try something on the medium because there was not too much to lose. But yeah, the soft was a good component. So, I think the soft was a good component.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Driver 40: And that's P9 for you today. And yeah, I think that's probably gonna stay P9. It's 11 seconds to press. But that's the Red Bull. Good effort, good fighting out there. Okay mate, P9 should be pleased with that. We've got Pascal ahead of us. I think you've defended very very hard. That was a good job. Mate, I gave that everything. There's nothing left. Yeah, that's what we need. That's why you're here mate. Okay, very good race mate. And you've got a lot of coverage. You should be pleased. You should be pleased. Same again next week. No time to rest. I can't hear that. Thank you guys for the hard work. It's good to get a couple of points. I feel like we've missed out on a bit, but you guys did a good job. And I really gave that everything. And we will do a practice art festival in Japan. Practice art festival in Japan. Please not. I know mate, I know. Apologies guys, because that's not good enough, honestly. That's okay. That's why we're here. We keep working. I'm good, Jermit. And I'm happy to get points. It's been a long, long season so far. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy.\n",

      "Driver 44: Well done Lewis mate, that's P8. Hard at work P8 but yeah well done mate. Yeah thanks Mono, that was a long slow and tough and confident. Yeah copy same here mate, but yeah got lots to look at and yeah get it sorted for the next two. Lewis, horrible for all of us, car can't go back like this from one race to the other, we need to find out what went wrong. But yeah thank you for surviving that. No no, let's speak after. Well done to the lads though, you know it's not the result we wanted but still did a really great job during the weekend to pit stops, thanks. Yeah thanks Lewis, much appreciated.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Driver 44: I think it's another lap man. Yes mate, yes. Just one more lap, that would have done it. But great job there mate, so that's P3 and fastest lap. Lewis, five hours later. Sir, yeah, I hear you Toto. Thanks so much for the support, for the positive words. It's not the easiest of weekends, but good result in the end. Thank you. Peace out guys.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Driver 63: The car doesn't feel right after that touch I'm just trying to bring home alright? Yeah AFIRM you're doing a really good job, you've got three laps remaining.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Driver 63: Okay, so that's P5. Good considering where we started. Shame about the trip to the Kinsdale Road. Ah, so sorry guys. Should have had that podium. So maybe it's weekend. Looked quite tricky out there. Tricky for everyone. George, nevertheless well done. You finished P5. You started P8. It was a horrible race. So right calls strategy wise and that's good. Good. Yeah, thanks Hoto. On to next week.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Driver 81: Sorry about that Oscar frustrating day, unfortunately that was set in turn one lap one with not being able to un-lap. Ricciardo fared similarly, so we finished P14 with retirement behind us. Yeah, it's over before it began, but thank you very much to everyone who fixed the car. It was a very, very impressive effort, so thank you. I still learnt a lot from getting the laps in today, so thank you very much to everyone who helped fix it. Thank you. Yeah, agreed Oscar, fantastic job getting the car back out.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Driver 81: Checkered flag, Oscar. Well done, mate. Well done. Finished P7. Really good job, mate. Ten places in the race. Fantastic. Yeah, thank you. Well done. And well done to Lando as well. I saw he was there for a lot of the race, so... Yeah, well done, everybody. Thank you to my guys. I know we're missing a couple of people.
