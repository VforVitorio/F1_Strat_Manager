It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.

      "Full transcription: Liam, can you hear me? Yeah, I can. Okay mate, so most likely the FIA will tell us which tire to use, either inter or extreme. But if they don't, and if we have a choice, so the extreme could be good very initially for the restart, but then the deg will be higher than the inter. So we have seven laps remaining, and likely to have a couple of safety car laps, so basically we probably have four or five race laps remaining. So have a think if you would like to try something, if you have a view, have a think if you have a view, otherwise we decide for you. For me, if it's more than three, four laps, like more than three laps, four laps racing, then the inter is going to be better, because I don't think they're going to let us race until it's in conditions where the inter is actually probably stronger. So I think the inter is better, but if it's like two, three laps, then the wets, maybe. Copy that. It's just because we're thinking about warm-up. So the inter, I agree, will be better, but we will have a couple of safety car laps, then a couple of warm-up laps. So there won't be very much of racing at a full tire temperature. That's why we are thinking about it.\n",
