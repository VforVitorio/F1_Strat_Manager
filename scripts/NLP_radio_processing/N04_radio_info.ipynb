    "**Advanced Text Understanding for F1 Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "For our F1 strategic decision system, we need to extract structured information from radio messages to feed our logic agent. Building on our successful sentiment analysis model, we'll implement a comprehensive approach to understand both the intent and specific entities in team radio communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Intent Classification with RoBERTa\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll fine-tune a RoBERTa model (similar to our sentiment analysis model) to classify radio messages into specific intent categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Order:** Direct instructions to the driver (\"Box this lap\", \"Push now\")\n",
    "- **Information:** Factual updates about race conditions (\"Hamilton is 2 seconds behind\")\n",
    "- **Question:** Queries requiring driver input (\"How are the tyres feeling?\")\n",
    "- **Warning:** Alerts about potential issues (\"Watch your fuel consumption\")\n",
    "- **Strategy:** Long-term planning elements (\"We're looking at Plan B\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This classification will help our logic agent understand the purpose of each communication and respond appropriately.\n",

    "\n",
    "We'll train a specialized SpaCy model to identify key racing entities in the text:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DRIVER:** References to specific drivers\n",
    "- **TEAM:** Team names and references\n",
    "- **TYRES:** Tyre compounds and conditions (soft, medium, hard, intermediate, wet)\n",
    "- **LAPNUM:** References to specific laps\n",
    "- **TIME_GAP:** Time differences mentioned in seconds\n",
    "- **STRATEGY:** Strategy terms (undercut, overcut, Plan A/B)\n",
    "- **TRACK_STATUS:** Track conditions (DRS, safety car, VSC)\n",

    "\n",
    "$Radio Message → [Sentiment Analysis] → [Intent Classification] → [Entity Extraction] → Structured Data$\n",

    "\n",
    "    Examples: \"How are the tyres feeling?\", \"Do you want to pit this lap?\", \"Are you happy with the balance?\"\n",
