    "# Lap time Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement rules related to lap time predictions with three main strategies: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Optimal Performance Window Rule**\n",
    "```\n",
    "IF (predicted LapTime < current LapTime AND Position > 3 AND TyreAge < 8)\n",
    "THEN recommend strategic push\n",
    "CONFIDENCE: 0.75\n",
    "```\n",
    "This rule will identify opportunities for drivers to push harder when lap times are improving and tires are relatively fresh. Since position data may be limited, we'll implement a flexible approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make the position condition optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Default to a reasonable assumption if position is unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use driver number as a proxy for position if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Performance Cliff Detection Rule**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "IF (predicted LapTime > current LapTime + 0.7 AND TyreAge > 15)\n",
    "THEN recommend priority pit stop\n",
    "CONFIDENCE: 0.85\n",
    "```\n",
    "This rule focuses on detecting significant performance drops that indicate a tire is reaching its limit, regardless of position data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Post-Traffic Recovery Rule**\n",
    "\n",
    "``\n",
    "IF (predicted LapTime < current LapTime - 0.5 AND Position changed negatively in last lap)\n",
    "THEN recommend recovery stint\n",
    "CONFIDENCE: 0.7`\n",
    "``\n",
    "For this rule, which requires position change data, we'll implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A position change detection mechanism based on available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A fallback mechanism that uses lap time increases as an indirect indicator of position loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An option to disable this rule if position data is completely unavailable."

    "## What We Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we successfully implemented an extension of our rule-based expert system focused on analyzing lap time predictions to identify strategic opportunities in Formula 1 racing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Analysis and Threshold Selection**\n",
    "   - Analyzed distribution of lap time differences to establish meaningful thresholds\n",
    "   - Determined that 0.7s is a significant slowdown (performance cliff)\n",
    "   - Established that 0.5s is a significant improvement (recovery opportunity)\n",
    "   - Set tire age thresholds at 8 laps (fresh) and 15 laps (old)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rule Implementation**\n",
    "   - Created `F1LapTimeRules` class extending the base `F1StrategyEngine`\n",
    "   - Implemented three strategic rules:\n",
    "     - **Optimal Performance Window**: Identifies when drivers can push harder with fresh tires\n",
    "     - **Performance Cliff Detection**: Detects when tires are reaching critical degradation\n",
    "     - **Post-Traffic Recovery**: Identifies opportunities to recover time after traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing Framework**\n",
    "   - Developed testing functions that work with both real and simulated data\n",
    "   - Implemented realistic data flow comparing current lap times with predictions\n",
    "   - Successfully validated rule activations in real race scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Results Validation**\n",
    "   - Verified that the rules correctly identify significant strategic moments\n",
    "   - Generated appropriate recommendations with explanations and priorities\n",
    "   - Demonstrated that the system can handle real race data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook extends our F1 Strategy Expert System with a critical dimension of analysis: lap time-based decision making, complementing the tire degradation rules implemented in Notebook N02.\n",
