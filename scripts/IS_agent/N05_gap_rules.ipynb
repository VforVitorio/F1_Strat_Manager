    "# N05: Gap-Based Strategy Rules for F1\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction and Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Gap analysis is a critical component of Formula 1 race strategy. The time difference between cars (measured in seconds) directly influences strategic decisions like undercuts, overcuts, and defensive pit stops. This notebook implements rules that use these gaps to make strategic recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Gap Analysis Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Undercut Opportunities:** When a car is close behind another (~1-2s), pitting earlier might allow overtaking through fresher tires\n",
    "* **Overcut Potential:** Sometimes staying out longer works better, especially when the leading car has clean air\n",
    "* **Defensive Strategy**: Teams must react when competitors attempt undercuts\n",
    "* **Traffic Management**: Gaps determine whether a car will exit the pits into free air or traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract and process gap data from FastF1 (replacing our previous computer vision approach)\n",
    "Analyze gap distributions to establish meaningful thresholds for strategic decisions\n",
    "Implement four key rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Undercut Opportunity Rule**: Identify when an undercut might succeed\n",
    "2. **Defensive Pit Stop Rule**: Protect position against undercut attempts\n",
    "3. **Overcut Strategy Rule:** Recognize when staying out longer is advantageous\n",
    "4. **Traffic Management Rule**: Avoid exiting pit stops into traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These rules will complement our existing components (tire degradation, lap time analysis, and radio communication) to create a comprehensive F1 strategy system."

    "### Undercut\n",
    "\n",
    "The F1 undercut is a strategic maneuver that can change the course of a race. When the chasing car is within about three seconds of the leader, the leader may choose to enter the pit lane early to switch to fresh tires.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this pit stop costs roughly 20–23 seconds, the significant performance boost from the fresh tires allows the leader to complete laps much faster than the car still running on worn tires. By the time the chaser paces into its own pit stop, the leader has gained enough of a time advantage to overtake on track. \n",
    "\n",
    "This short-term benefit—gaining extra pace due to better tire grip—is critical on circuits with high tire degradation, such as Barcelona.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overcut\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the overcut is a similar concept with an opposite approach. Rather than pitting early, a driver using the overcut strategy remains on the track with worn tires for a longer period while the competitors pit.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the driver can maintain competitive lap times despite the older rubber—or if the competitors’ new tires take extra time to warm up—the longer stint can yield a time advantage. Once the rival makes its pit stop, the overcutting driver then pits later and, thanks to having run a more consistent pace in clean air, can gain positions on the circuit.\n",

    "## Gap Data Processing: Summary and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We've Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Extraction**\n",
    "  - Loaded 2023 Spanish Grand Prix lap data with FastF1.\n",
    "  - Implemented precise gap calculation at each lap completion.\n",
    "  - Computed key metrics: gap to leader, gap to car ahead, and gap to car behind.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strategic Metrics**\n",
    "  - Added strategic flags: undercut window (gap < 2.5s) and DRS window (gap < 1.0s).\n",
    "  - Calculated percentages for strategic opportunities.\n",
    "  - Generated comprehensive statistics on gap distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning**\n",
    "  - Identified and filled missing values with appropriate placeholders.\n",
    "  - Marked the leader (no car ahead) and the last position (no car behind).\n",
    "  - Created a clean dataset ready for rule implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Persistence**\n",
    "  - Saved the processed gap data to CSV with consistent formatting.\n",
    "  - Ensured the data is structured for integration with our expert system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gap-Based Rule Implementation**\n",
    "  - Define a `F1GapRules` class inheriting from `F1StrategyEngine` (similar to the approach in N04 for radio communication rules).\n",
    "  - Implement four key strategic rules:\n",
    "    - **Undercut Opportunity Rule:** Recommend early pit stops when following closely (e.g., `GapToCarAhead < 2.5s` along with favorable conditions like tire age and degradation).\n",
    "    - **Defensive Pit Stop Rule:** Recommend defensive actions when being closely followed (e.g., when `GapToCarBehind < 2.5s` and the gap is decreasing).\n",
    "    - **Overcut Strategy Rule:** Suggest staying out longer in clean air when leading cars pit.\n",
    "    - **Traffic Management Rule:** Use gap data to predict post-pit positions and avoid pitting into traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testing and Integration**\n",
    "  - Create a testing framework (similar to `test_radio_rules` in N04) to validate each rule using processed gap data.\n",
    "  - Combine these rules with tire degradation (N02), lap time (N03), and radio rules (N04).\n",
    "  - Implement conflict resolution and adjust priorities based on the reliability and importance of different data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "These gap-based rules will complete our strategic decision support system by addressing the critical aspect of relative positioning and the strategic opportunities it creates during races.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Identifying Undercut Opportunities**: When a car should pit early to gain track position\n",
    "2. **Defensive Strategy**: When a car should respond to potential undercuts from behind\n",
    "3. **Overcut Potential**: When staying out longer on old tires might be advantageous\n",
    "4. **Traffic Management**: Avoiding exiting the pits into slower traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "Gap analysis is one of the most important aspects of F1 strategy, as positions are often gained and lost through pit stop timing rather than on-track overtaking, especially on circuits where passing is difficult.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Rule 1: Undercut Opportunity\n",
    "- **Condition**: Gap to car ahead < 2.0s AND tire degradation rate > 0.12 AND tire age > 8 laps\n",
    "- **Action**: Recommend performing an undercut (pitting before the car ahead)\n",

    "- **Confidence**: 0.8 (80%)\n",

    "#### Rule 2: Defensive Pit Stop\n",
    "- **Condition**: Gap to car behind < 2.5s AND gap is decreasing AND tire degradation rate > 0.1\n",
    "- **Action**: Recommend a defensive pit stop to protect position\n",
    "- **Rationale**: When being followed closely by a faster car, pitting first prevents being undercut\n",
    "- **Confidence**: 0.75 (75%)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rule 3: Strategic Overcut\n",
    "- **Condition**: Gap to car ahead < 3.5s AND predicted lap time < car ahead's lap time AND tire degradation rate < 0.1\n",
    "- **Action**: Recommend staying out longer (overcut strategy)\n",
    "- **Rationale**: When tires are still performing well and we have better pace, staying out while others pit can gain track position\n",
    "- **Confidence**: 0.75 (75%)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rule 4: Traffic Management\n",
    "- **Condition**: Potential to exit pits into slower traffic (cars that are about to be lapped)\n",
    "- **Action**: Recommend adjusting pit window to avoid traffic\n",
    "- **Rationale**: Exiting the pits behind slower cars can cost several seconds of race time, even if they're a lap down\n",
    "- **Confidence**: 0.7 (70%)\n",
