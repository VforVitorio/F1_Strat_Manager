## 6. Video Analysis and gap_calculation.ipynb Integration

### 6.1. Video Upload and Processing Interface

- Add a section in the application where the user can upload a race video.

- Provide UI controls to configure detection parameters (e.g., detection thresholds, frame range) from the app interface.
- Allow the user to start, pause, and step through the video analysis.

### 6.3. Real-Time Visualization and LLM Integration

- Display detection results (gaps, objects, events) overlaid on the video in real time or per frame.
- Add a window where a vision-capable LLM can analyze selected video segments and generate insights, explanations, or answer user queries about the video.
