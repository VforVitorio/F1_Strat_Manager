    "# Tire Degradation Prediction Model - Week 5\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook implements advanced models to predict tire degradation in Formula 1 races. Since tire degradation is not strictly linear and depends on multiple factors (compound type, track temperature, driving style, etc.), we'll use sequence models like LSTM to capture these complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "1. **Data Exploration**\n",
    "   - Analyze the relationship between lap times and tire age\n",
    "   - Visualize performance degradation patterns by compound\n",
    "   - Determine how to quantify \"degradation\" (lap time delta or derived metric)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "   - Create a derived tire degradation metric\n",
    "   - Organize data into sequential format for LSTM\n",
    "   - Normalize features appropriately\n",
    "   - Create sliding windows of previous laps to predict future performance\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Development**\n",
    "   - **Primary Model**: LSTM network to predict degradation trajectory\n",
    "   - **Alternative Model**: XGBoost with quantile regression for uncertainty estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation & Visualization**\n",
    "   - Compare predicted vs. actual degradation curves\n",
    "   - Analyze performance across different compounds and race conditions\n",
    "   - Create interactive Plotly visualizations of degradation patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Implementation Details**\n",
    "   - Sequence length: 5 laps (input) → predict next 3-5 laps\n",
    "   - Features: Tire age, compound, lap time trends, fuel load\n",
    "   - Target: Derived degradation metric or direct lap time prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "- Trained model to predict tire performance over extended stints\n",
    "- Uncertainty bounds for degradation predictions (10th, 50th, 90th percentiles)\n",
    "- Interactive visualization of degradation curves by compound"

    "- There is a bigger volatile effect that it seemed without fuel effect.\n",
