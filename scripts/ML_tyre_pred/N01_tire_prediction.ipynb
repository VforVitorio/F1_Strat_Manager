    "# Tire Degradation Prediction Model - Week 5\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook implements advanced models to predict tire degradation in Formula 1 races. Since tire degradation is not strictly linear and depends on multiple factors (compound type, track temperature, driving style, etc.), we'll use sequence models like LSTM to capture these complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "1. **Data Exploration**\n",
    "   - Analyze the relationship between lap times and tire age\n",
    "   - Visualize performance degradation patterns by compound\n",
    "   - Determine how to quantify \"degradation\" (lap time delta or derived metric)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "   - Create a derived tire degradation metric\n",
    "   - Organize data into sequential format for LSTM\n",
    "   - Normalize features appropriately\n",
    "   - Create sliding windows of previous laps to predict future performance\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Development**\n",
    "   - **Primary Model**: LSTM network to predict degradation trajectory\n",
    "   - **Alternative Model**: XGBoost with quantile regression for uncertainty estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation & Visualization**\n",
    "   - Compare predicted vs. actual degradation curves\n",
    "   - Analyze performance across different compounds and race conditions\n",
    "   - Create interactive Plotly visualizations of degradation patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Implementation Details**\n",
    "   - Sequence length: 5 laps (input) â†’ predict next 3-5 laps\n",
    "   - Features: Tire age, compound, lap time trends, fuel load\n",
    "   - Target: Derived degradation metric or direct lap time prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "- Trained model to predict tire performance over extended stints\n",
    "- Uncertainty bounds for degradation predictions (10th, 50th, 90th percentiles)\n",
    "- Interactive visualization of degradation curves by compound"

    "#### Medium Tire (Yellow).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The fuel effect was masking significantly degradation. With the adjustment, mroe degradation can be seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They offer the best initial advantage (-4 seconds), that stabilizes in -3 seconds until aproximately lap 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total fuel impact is about 1.73 seconds faster at the end of the stint.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They represent the best balance between performance and durability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hard Tire (Gray)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fuel effect made an stabilization ilusion and even improvement. The adjust reveals a constant and progressive degradation that goes up to +2seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fuel effect on this tires are the biggest, with 2.64 fastet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Degradation rate is more stable and predictable, making them ideal for long stints.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Soft Tire (Red)\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a bigger volatile effect that it seemed without fuel effect.\n",
    "- Erratic behaviour and big fluctuations after lap 20.\n",
    "- Highly unpredictable and dramatically fluctating, specially after lap 20, with extreme degradation peaks of +2 seconds slower per lap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detected Turning Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- *SOFT*: show a cliff degradation over 20 laps.\n",
    "- *MEDIUM*: change in pattern near lap 30.\n",
    "- *HARD*: show a degradation increase after lap 40.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Good Conclussions for predictive model. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fuel adjustment was essential for identifying true degradation.\n",
    "2. Each compound shows unique patterns that can be useful for the model:\n",
    "    - Soft tire as high volatile with critic points of sudden degradation.\n",
    "    - Medium tire has a fast fall followed by stabilization.\n",
    "    - Hard tire with slow but continous degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Identified turning points are going to be crucial parameters for the LSTM or XgBoost, as they show critic moments for pit stop strategies."

    "### Explanation of Sequences and Targets\n",
    "#### What does the `create_sequences` function do?\n",
    "The function creates data in a sequential format, necessary for training LSTM models. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequences:**\n",
    "- They are \"sliding windows\" of consecutive data from the same set of tires.\n",
    "- Each sequence contains data from 5 consecutive laps (all DataFrame columns).\n",
    "- They represent the \"recent history\" that the model will use to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Targets:**\n",
    "- These are the values we want to predict in the future.\n",
    "- Each target contains the degradation values for the next 3 laps after the sequence.\n",
    "- It only includes the column we want to predict (`FuelAdjustedDegPercent`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concrete Example\n",
    "Imagine we have data from 10 laps with the same tire:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequence 1:** Laps 1-5\n",
    "  - **Target 1:** Degradation in laps 6-8\n",
    "- **Sequence 2:** Laps 2-6\n",
    "  - **Target 2:** Degradation in laps 7-9\n",
    "- **Sequence 3:** Laps 3-7\n",

    "- Targets always represent the next 3 laps after each sequence.\n",
    "- Example: Sequence 0 ends at lap 5, targets are laps 6, 7, 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coherence Between Sequences and Targets:\n",
    "- The target values also \"slide\" accordingly:\n",
    "  - **Target of Sequence 0:** `[-3.88, -3.73, -4.36]`\n",

    "- The first two values of Target 1 match the last two of Target 0.\n",

    "#### Maintaining Structure by Driver, Stint, and Compound:\n",
    "- All shown sequences belong to the same driver (1), same stint (1.0), and same compound (2).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Implications for Our LSTM Model\n",

    "- It can predict degradation for the next 3 laps using the previous 5 laps.\n",
    "- The data structure captures both the absolute degradation level and its rate of change.\n",
    "\n",
